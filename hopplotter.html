                <h1>Redesigning HopPlotter app</h1>
                <div class="blog-content">
                <h2>HopPlotter</h2>
                <p>HopPlotter is an app that helps people locate and visit craft breweries. It has over 7,000 breweries on this app and is ranked no 1 on the app market to find breweries.</p>

                <h2>The project</h2>
                <p>HopPlotter’s team would like to understand the current usability issues of the app and recommend steps for improvement. They are also open to ideas to improve customer experience.</p>

                <h2>Role in the team</h2>
                <p>UX Researcher</p>

                <h1>The Team</h1>

                    </a>

                </div>

                <h2>UX Research Process</h2>
                <p style="text-align: justify">A survey (using Qualtrics) was created with 10 questions including demographics. We received 22 responses out of 60 people that were sent the survey. The questions asked ranged from their frequencies of visit to breweries, their knowledge on breweries, beer making etc. From 22 responders, I decided to proceed with three users for usability testing: Erika, Dominic and Mackie. Erika is a casual beer drinker and would go to a brewery for fun and hang out with friends, Dom is an avid beer drinker and is well informed about the various aspects of their beer consumption. Mackie is well informed about breweries and beers. She has friends who she identifies as “beer snobs”. She learns a lot from them. After the first round of usability testing with the responders and the team, I documented the key findings as follows.</p>

                    </a>

                </div>


                 <h2>Key Findings: Pre wireframing usability testing</h2>

                 <ul class="list-style">
                     <li> The HopPlotter app focuses too much on promoting third-party competitors (Untapped, Beer list and Yelp) and includes features that are more distracting than helpful, making finding breweries too vague and less efficient </li>
                     <li> 2 out of 3 users were not a fan of the Untapped app integration as they don’t want to go to another app and to be asked to log in to that app </li>
                     <li> 3 out of 3 users wanted bigger maps on individual brewery profiles and an integration with google maps </li>
                     <li> 3 out of 3 users liked the uber integration </li>
                     <li> 3 out of 3 users wanted more filters to be added to the app such as "brewpubs" , "pet friendly", "taprooms" </li>
                     <li> 2 out of 3 users wanted more pictures for individual breweries profile page </li>
                     <li> Out of 3 users 1 didn’t feel social media integration for reviews were necessary, one said they don’t care much for it and one thought it was important </li>
                     <li> 2 out of 3 users like the ratings that they see from untapped (but do not like the integration with the app as when they click it, they are taken to another app to sign in). Reviews are helpful </li>
                     <li> 3 out of 3 users were clear about “visit” and “save “options (clicking visit takes you to the next page where you add to a “Trip” that you have created and save, will save the brewery </li>
                     <li> One user was not sure how to move the selected brewery from one list to another; Edit list placement wasn't clear </li>
                     <li> One user was more inclined to do swipe delete but it was a tap once and select remove option </li>
                 </ul>

                 <h2>Persona Creation</h2>
                 <p>After going through the data from our Qualtrics report (using cross tabs) I found that males mostly in the age group of 31-40 married without kids or with domestic partners are more likely to visit the pub/brewery 3 times or more in a month, keeping all these data In mind I created the primary persona of HOMER GREEN a 31 year old graphic designer.</p>

                         <img src="images/hopplotter-persona.png" alt="">
                     </a>
                 </div>

                 <h2>Storyboard</h2>
                 <div class="post-lightbox row">
                     <a href="images/hopplotter-storyboard.png" class="col-md-12 col-sm-12 col-xs-12 lightbox-image link">

                     </a>
                 </div>

                 <h2>User Flow</h2>
                 <div class="post-lightbox row">
                     <a href="images/hopplotter-userflow.jpg" class="col-md-12 col-sm-12 col-xs-12 lightbox-image link">
                         <img src="images/hopplotter-userflow.jpg" alt="">
                     </a>
                 </div>

                 <h2>Wireframing</h2>
                 <p>The interaction designer, Lauren after being briefed by me about all these key finding created wireframes for the app for IPhone X keeping in mind the guidelines provided by Apple resources.</p>
                 <h2>Success Metrics</h2>
                 <p>We as a team also discussed about the success metrics that would be integral in the design process and deciding which features to prioritize. Those success metrics are as follows.</p>
                 <ul class="list-style">
                     <li> Increase in the number of app downloads </li>
                     <li> Increased number of people who create accounts with the app and created a trip </li>
                     <li> Increase app share via Facebook, Instagram, text and email </li>
                 </ul>
                 <div class="post-lightbox row">
                     <a href="images/hopplotter-wireframing.png" class="col-md-12 col-sm-12 col-xs-12 lightbox-image link">
                         <img src="images/hopplotter-wireframing.png" alt="">
                     </a>
                 </div>

                 <p>We asked users to perform a few tasks:</p>
                 <ul class="list-style">
                     <li> Allow location settings to access their location </li>
                     <li> Check for a brewery </li>
                     <li> Add the brewery to the visit list; Plot the brewery </li>
                     <li> Add another brewery to save </li>
                     <li> Move the brewery from one list to another </li>
                     <li> Write a review for the brewery </li>
                 </ul>

                 <h2>Key Findings: Post wireframing usability testing</h2>
                 <ul class="list-style">
                     <li> One user was trying to figure out how to go back from the review page to home (The design of which was later modified) </li>
                     <li> "<" was clicked by 2 users to go back to the home page </li>
                     <li> Map = Home was not easily understandable and we had to change the name of the tab from Map to Home </li>
                     <li> 2 out of 3 users kept clicking on "<" to go back home ( We asked them "How will you go back to the home page"?, maybe they put more emphasis on going BACK instead of going home; for our third and last user we asked them, "How will you go to the home page?", we were careful not to use "back to the home page, "She was able to go to the home page without clicking on "<") </li>
                     <li> Mackie, our last user—who is also a beer enthusiast—found the nav easy and the interface self-explanatory </li>
                 </ul>

                 <h2>The Solution (Research +IXD)</h2>
                 <ul class="list-style">
                     <li> After feedback from a user we changed the position of the home tab from far right to far left </li>
                     <li> Removed untapped integration </li>
                     <li> Map was removed from individual brewery profile </li>
                     <li> Added more filters </li>
                     <li> Navigation was made simpler </li>
                     <li> We updated the 'my trips' page to show the plotted trip and added a map to it </li>
                     <li> Changed the tab name from "Map" to "home" because it was difficult to go to main page </li>
                     <li> Added ability to 'write review' </li>
                     <li> Calendar picker </li>
                 </ul>

                 <h2>Final Prototype</h2>
